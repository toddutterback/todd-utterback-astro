This site is intentionally small.

It’s not a résumé, and it’s not a content machine. I don't even know how I'd benefit from a content machine, but this isn't one. 

I've been keeping a journal in [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/) for over a decade. It's where I record a lot of my life and experiences, and I'll keep doing that over there. 

But I've been missing the friction and refinement that come from thinking in public. So, this is a place to write down things I’ve learned, things I’m noticing, and ideas I’m still forming.

I trust writing as a tool for:

- organizing my thoughts and pushing my thinking forward
- validating (and remembering) my experiences
- leaving a trail for future me (and anyone else who’s interested)

If something here resonates, feel free to reach out.
