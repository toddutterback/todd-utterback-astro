I wanted to be part of Utah Tech Week 2026, even though I couldn't make it out this year. Sponsoring UTW as an individual was something playful that came together unexpectedly, and I'm so glad it did. Kudos to Trent Mano for creating the space for some merrymaking.

The best perk of being a sponsor, that I've seen so far, is this: I get to call myself _The Official Engineering Leader of Utah Tech Week._ Maybe forever. Maybe until someone outbids me, in which case I'll happily say I was the first. 

For me, there is another reinforcing lesson in this little adventure. A bias towards action. Even a small action. Say "yes". Do the thing you've been thinking about. Follow through on a hairbrained idea. 

I learn best from action, big and small.

Let's keep making moves.
