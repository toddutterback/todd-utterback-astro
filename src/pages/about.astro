	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		I lead software teams, and I like building at startups, where the stakes are high. When the team wins, the company wins. 
        The problems are real, the constraints matter, and the work directly shapes whether the business succeeds.
	</p>

	<p>
		I strongly believe in something Clayton Christensen taught: 
        “Management is the most noble of professions if it’s practiced well. No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team."
	</p>

	<p>
		My default mode is practical. Building a winning culture starts with agreeing on the standard and doing the 
        simple things well, then keep doing them over and over. Make it a habit. 
        No two teams are the same, but success is always earned through consistency and accountability.
